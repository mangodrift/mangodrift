## Iâ€™m Otelo Tavares ðŸ‘‹
Originally from the sunny shores of Portugal, but now pursuing my studies in Bremen, Germany. I am very interested in exploring ai / machine learning and web development, always striving to blend creativity with code.

Much like my namesake from Shakespeare's famous play, I'm driven by a deep curiosity and a desire to understand the world around meâ€”only in my case, it's through algorithms and data. While the original Othello faced complex challenges in love and life, my challenges involve solving complex problems in code, but with much less drama :D
